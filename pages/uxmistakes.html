          <h1>Opening Errors</h1>
          <p>Firstly, often times, when opening the app, the app would close without fully Opening </p>
          <p>When opening the app, if it lets you in, the user is greeted with a page to select their school. Though this is a great initial opening page, every time the user needs to get into the app, they are directed to this screen. This is poor UX design as it takes the user too long to find their school to then just be directed to the log in screen.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <h1>Opening Errors</h1>
          <p>The first correction for the inital log in and opening screen is to correct the loading of the app. Often time the app will not pass the initial blue opening screen.</p>
          <p>Though the screen showed before when picking the users school is a good opening screen, once the user picks the school, it should not ask the user again. The app should open each time to either log in on the schools page or to bypass logging in once the user does so. </p>

    <div class="flip-card"> <!--Log In Errors-->
      <div class="flip-card-inner">
        <div class="flip-card-front">
          <h1>Log In Errors</h1>
          <p>After selecting their school they are then prompted to log in to their account, the app opens what looks like a seperate web page on top of the initial log in screen for the user to enter their credentials. Or create a new account.</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <h1>Log In Errors</h1>
          <p>The "Welcome to Apogee ResNedt for the University of North Alabama" is a great opening screen. I believe it should be the initial screen after the blue intro screen. When selecting to log-in or to create an account a new, seperate page pops up, that doesnt take up the full screen. </p>
          <p>To fix this error I would recommend making the log in page on the same type of page the Welcome Page is on and keep that format for the rest of the app.</p>

    <div class="flip-card"> <!--Limiting the addition of new devices-->
      <div class="flip-card-inner">
        <div class="flip-card-front">
          <h1>Limiting new devices</h1>
          <p>After the user has logged into their new or existing account, they are greeted with the option to add up to 7 devices under their name.</p>
          <img src="/img/homepage.jpg" width="300" height="600" class="center" alt="PUT HOME PAGE HERE">
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <h1>Limiting new devices</h1>
          <p>When opening you account you are greeted with the amount of devices you have registered, which has been limited to 7. </p>
          <p>To better this system, I believe you should be able to add an unlimited amount of devices but only have 7 connected to the wifi. Often, when people come visit that need the wifi, users have to delete one of their inactive ones (for example an iPad that isnt being used) and this causes the user to spend extra time registering, deleting, and reregistering devices that do not need to be used at the same time. </p>

      <div class="flip-card-inner">
        <div class="flip-card-front">
          <h1>Adding new devices</h1>
          
          <p>When adding a new device, what they do not tell the user when putting down their information was that for the WIFI to work, the user must turn off their private address in their (necessary) devices settings. If they do not do this, the WIFI will not work. Though they do include the information, they put it under a help tab that is not accessible from the add a device page.</p>
          <p>When choosing the applicable device that the user is setting up, they are greeted with an excessive number of devices, some are even duplicates.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="column">

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <h1>Adding new devices</h1>
          <p>After selecting to add a new device, the user is asked to enter their device type, name of the device, and MAC Address. These are all important entries, but normally, users are not used to entering a MAC address to connect to wifi. To better handle this, there should be a section underneath the "clear form" and Image button to tell the user how to get to their MAC address based on the device they listed.</p>
          <p>Speaking of devices listed, there is no need for there to be an excessive amount of devices underneath the device options. The device amount should be limited to broad categories such as "Phone", "Computer/Laptop", "Television", "Gaming system", "Printer", and so on.</p>
          <p>Additionally, underneath the "clear form" and Image button there should be an alert that for devices such as smart phones, the Private Wi-Fi address needs to be turned off. Without doing so, the Wi-Fi will not connect. It is told to the user in the app, but it is not in an obvious place, and often users miss it.</p>

          <h1>No contact for customer support</h1>
          <p>On the home screen, under the 7 devices they have registered is an option to contact customer support. Unfortunately, this button does not serve a purpose as they have no customer service representatives.</p>

          <h1>No contact for customer support</h1>
          <p>Underneath the list of devices, there is a support section that serves no purpose. To make the UI better, I would remove this section as all of the information is listed in the "?" in the top right corner.</p>
          <p>Additionally, there is no customer support available and the user is only provided with a list of FAQ.</p>

          <p>On the second page tab labled "devices", the user can see all the devices they have registered. At the bottom of the page, they are greeted with the option to upgrade to add more devices. This is a great idea, but they do not let the user upgrade to more devices under any circumstance.</p>

          <h1>Upgrade devices option</h1>
          <p>On the Devices page, there is a list of all devices that you have registered (up to 7 of course). Underneath the devices, if the user has 7 devices registered, they are given the option to "Upgrade for more devices". This is totally fake as there is no way to upgrade the service.</p>
          <p>To correct this, I would delete the option to upgrade for More Devices entirely.</p>
